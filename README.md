### Wiring Diagram

```
Heltec WiFi Kit 32 V3
├── GPIO 0  ← Built-in PRG button (primary button)
├── GPIO 2  ← External button (optional)
├── GPIO 48 → Piezo buzzer positive (+)
├── GND     → Piezo buzzer negative (-)
└── Battery → 3.7V LiPo via JST connector
```

The Heltec board has a built-in OLED display, so no additional wiring needed for the screen!

### 3D Printed Case

STL files for the enclosure are in the [`hardware/3d-models/`](hardware/3d-models/) directory:
- `case-top.stl` - Top shell
- `case-bottom.stl` - Bottom shell with battery compartment
- `button-cap.stl` - Optional button cap

Print settings: PLA, 0.2mm layer height, 20% infill

## Build Your Own

### Prerequisites

1. **Arduino IDE 2.x** or **PlatformIO**
2. **ESP32 Board Support** - Add Heltec ESP32 to your Arduino boards manager
3. **Required Libraries**:
   - `WiFiManager` by tzapu
   - `ArduinoJson` by Benoit Blanchon
   - `Heltec ESP32 Dev-Boards` board package

### Arduino IDE Setup

1. **Add Heltec Board Manager URL:**
   ```
   File → Preferences → Additional Board Manager URLs:
   https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series/releases/download/0.0.9/package_heltec_esp32_index.json
   ```

2. **Install Board Package:**
   ```
   Tools → Board → Boards Manager → Search "Heltec" → Install
   ```

3. **Select Board:**
   ```
   Tools → Board → Heltec ESP32 Series Dev-Boards → WiFi Kit 32(V3)
   ```

4. **Install Libraries:**
   ```
   Tools → Manage Libraries → Search and install:
   - WiFiManager
   - ArduinoJson
   ```

## Flashing

1. Connect your Heltec board via USB-C

2. Open `firmware/satoshi_pet_heltec.ino` in Arduino IDE

3. Select the correct port:
   ```
   Tools → Port → /dev/cu.usbserial-* (Mac) or COM* (Windows)
   ```

4. Click **Upload** (→ button)

5. Wait for flashing to complete (~30 seconds)

## Connecting

### First-Time Setup

1. **Power on** your freshly flashed device
2. **Connect to WiFi**: The device creates a hotspot called `SatoshiPet-Setup`
   - Connect to this WiFi from your phone/laptop
   - A captive portal opens - enter your home WiFi credentials
3. **Get Pairing Code**: Device displays a 6-character code
4. **Link to Ganamos**:
   - Go to [ganamos.earth/connect-pet](https://ganamos.earth/connect-pet)
   - Create an account if you don't have one
   - Enter the pairing code to link your device

### Reconnecting

If you change WiFi networks:
1. Hold the button for 5+ seconds
2. Device enters WiFi setup mode
3. Connect to `SatoshiPet-Setup` and enter new credentials

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│  Satoshi Pet    │ ←WiFi→  │   Ganamos.earth │
│  (ESP32 Device) │         │   (Backend)     │
└────────┬────────┘         └────────┬────────┘
         │                           │
         │  1. Fetch config          │
         │  ──────────────────────→  │
         │  (balance, coins, jobs)   │
         │  ←──────────────────────  │
         │                           │
         │  2. Spend coins           │
         │  ──────────────────────→  │
         │  (feed, play game)        │
         │  ←──────────────────────  │
         │                           │
         │  3. Submit game score     │
         │  ──────────────────────→  │
         │  (leaderboard update)     │
         │  ←──────────────────────  │
         │                           │
```

The device polls the Ganamos API every 20-30 seconds to:
- Check your current balance
- Receive new coins when you earn Bitcoin
- Get notified of new jobs
- Sync pet care actions

## API Endpoints

The firmware communicates with these public endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/device/config` | Fetch balance, coins, notifications |
| `POST /api/device/spend-coins` | Spend coins for feeding/games |
| `POST /api/device/game-score` | Submit game high scores |
| `GET /api/device/jobs` | Fetch available jobs |
| `POST /api/device/job-complete` | Mark a job as completed |

## Troubleshooting

### Device won't connect to WiFi
- Hold button 5+ seconds to enter WiFi setup mode
- Make sure you're connecting to 2.4GHz network (not 5GHz)

### Pairing code not accepted
- Make sure you're entering the code exactly as shown
- Try power cycling the device to generate a new code

### Pet shows wrong balance
- Balance syncs every 20-30 seconds
- Check your internet connection
- Try pressing the button to force a refresh

### Screen stays off
- Device enters power-save mode after inactivity
- Press any button to wake up
- Check battery charge level
